# Bikesharing
Module 14 Intro to Tableau.
All visuals were made with Tableau Public [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/Module14IntrotoTableauDUDataAnalytics/AnalysisofCitiBike?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

# Overview:
The goal is to use Tableau to create a visual, to aid in the solidification of the bike-sharing program to investors. Since we already went through the basics of tableau.  We needed to address a few more things to our analysis for the proposal to be complete. In order to do that, a few things had to be accomplished.  We needed to use our knowledge of Pandas to alter the trip duration data set from an integer to a datetime to create the new visuals. 

# Results:
The first graph that was created, was the Total trips and the peak riding hours for all genders. What it showed was that out of the total number of trips, the peak riding hours was 17:00hrs. While the least populated time to check out a bike was 03:00.

The next graph: Bike checkout times for all the users. Showed that out of 146,752 riders the average riders checked out a bike for roughly five minutes.

The relationship of bikes check out by gender. Highlighted those who identified as men, were the ones who checked out bikes the most. Followed by those who chose not to identify. Last, those who identified as women had the lowest number of bikes checked out.

The Peak hours via heat map, showed that Monday- Friday. Between the hours of 08:00-09:00hrs are morning peak check out times for users. While hours 17:00-19:00hrs were evening peak hours.

Peak hours by gender via heat map showed us that those who identified as men had the most number of bike check outs. Between the hours of 08:00-09:00hrs and 17:00-19:00hrs.

Last, Users trip by gender: Showed us the relationship between customer, and subscriber by week based on gender. When broken down, it shows that female customers use the bikes the most on Saturday and Sunday. While men subscribers use the bike the most during Thursdays. But the men subscribers do frequently use the bike Monday-Sunday.

# Summary: 
According to the Des Moines Register, 2022. Des Moines Iowa is actually a hidden gem for young professionals. Given the data provided. It does seem feasible to have a bike-sharing program in an up and coming city. Where young professionals are thriving, and being conscious of alternative forms of transportation. 

Furthermore, two additional visualizations could be Customer vs Subscriber to determine who frequently uses the bikes, and those who just use it occasionally for recreational use. Or Birth year and gender. To determine what specific age rage is using the bikes the most.
